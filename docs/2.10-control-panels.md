# Control Panels

The Control Panels app in syaOS serves as the central hub for customizing your desktop environment and system preferences. It provides intuitive access to personalize your experience, from visual aesthetics to crucial system behaviors, ensuring syaOS adapts to your unique workflow and style.

## Overview

Control Panels is the primary application for managing and personalizing your syaOS experience. Users can fine-tune various aspects of the desktop environment, including its visual presentation, audio feedback, and underlying system configurations. This app is designed for both casual users looking to customize their workspace and advanced users needing to adjust core system settings or perform maintenance tasks like data backup and restoration. Its intuitive tabbed interface ensures that all settings are easily discoverable and manageable, providing a comprehensive solution for tailoring syaOS to individual preferences and operational requirements.

## User Guide

### Getting Started
To launch the Control Panels app, locate its icon in the syaOS Start Menu or Taskbar. Once open, navigate through the various settings categories using the tabs provided at the top of the window, each dedicated to a specific area of system configuration.

### Key Actions

*   **Manage Sounds:** In the "Sounds" tab, use the volume mixer to adjust audio levels. Toggle switches allow you to enable or disable specific sound effects like UI feedback, typing sounds, and application-specific audio.
*   **Select AI Model:** Access the "AI Model" section to choose the intelligence engine that best suits your needs for AI-powered features across syaOS applications.
*   **Backup/Restore Settings:** Utilize the "Backup & Restore" options to export your current syaOS configuration and files, or import a previously saved backup to restore your settings.
*   **Change Language:** Go to the "Language" settings to switch the syaOS interface to your desired language, providing a localized experience.
*   **Perform System Actions:** Under the "System" tab, you can reset individual app preferences to their defaults or, with caution, initiate a format of the virtual file system to clear all user data.

### Tips & Shortcuts
*   The Control Panels app uses a clear, tabbed interface for easy navigation between different categories of settings. Click on a tab (e.g., "Appearance", "Sounds") to quickly jump to that specific section.
*   Many settings, such as sound toggles, utilize simple on/off switches for quick and intuitive adjustments.
*   For complex settings like wallpaper selection, dedicated pickers (`WallpaperPicker`, `ScreenSaverPicker`) provide visual previews and a range of options for easy customization.
*   System-level actions, such as "Format File System," typically require confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental data loss and ensure user intent.
