## User Guide

### Getting Started
To launch Photo Booth, simply locate its icon in the syaOS application launcher and click on it. The app will open, activate your webcam, and display a live feed, ready for you to start capturing photos.

### Key Actions

*   **Taking a Photo:** To capture a single image, click the large red camera button located prominently in the application's interface. A shutter sound will confirm your photo has been taken.
*   **Quick Snaps:** For a burst of photos, click the timer button, positioned to the left of the main camera button. This will initiate a countdown, capturing four photos one second apart, ideal for dynamic shots.
*   **Applying Visual Effects:** To add fun filters to your live feed, click the effects button (often represented by an icon like a magic wand or palette). This will typically open a menu or carousel of available effects that you can apply in real-time.
*   **Managing Photos:** Click the photo stack button (usually found on the far left) to toggle the visibility of the photo strip at the bottom of the window. This strip displays all the photos you've taken in the current session.
*   **Downloading Photos:** To save a photo from the app to your syaOS file system, simply click on the desired photo within the photo strip. The image will be downloaded automatically.
*   **Switching Cameras:** If your device has multiple webcams connected, look for a camera switch button (often an icon with two arrows forming a circle) to cycle through and select your preferred camera input.

### Tips & Shortcuts
*   **Swipe Gestures:** On touch-enabled devices or with a trackpad, you can often swipe left or right across the main camera view to quickly cycle through different visual effects.
*   **Reviewing Photos:** Use the photo strip to quickly review your captures. Clicking on a photo not only downloads it but might also bring it into a larger preview for closer inspection.
