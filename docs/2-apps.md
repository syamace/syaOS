## App Architecture

All apps follow a consistent architecture pattern:

### Component Structure
- **App Component** (`[AppName]AppComponent.tsx`): Main app UI component
- **Menu Bar** (`[AppName]MenuBar.tsx`): App-specific menu bar with commands
- **Sub-components**: App-specific UI components organized by feature

### State Management
- Apps use **Zustand stores** for global state (e.g., `useIpodStore`, `useSoundboardStore`)
- Local component state for UI-specific concerns
- IndexedDB persistence for user data (songs, soundboards, etc.)

### Window Configuration
Each app defines window constraints:
- `defaultSize`: Initial window dimensions
- `minSize` / `maxSize`: Resize constraints
- `mobileDefaultSize`: Mobile-specific sizing
- `mobileSquare`: Square aspect ratio for mobile

### Lazy Loading
Most apps are lazy-loaded for performance:
- Finder loads eagerly (critical path)
- Other apps load on-demand when opened
- Reduces initial bundle size
